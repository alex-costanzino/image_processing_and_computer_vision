        "## Canny's edge detector\r\n",
        "Canny proposed certain quantitative criteria to measure the performance of an edge detector, and the find the optimal filter wrt such criteria:\r\n",
        "1. **Good detection**: the filter should extract correctly edges in noisy images (robustness to noise);\r\n",
        "1. **Good localization**: the distance between the found edge and the \"true\" edge should be minimum (precision);\r\n",
        "3. **One response to one edge**: the filter should detect one single edge pixel at each \"true\" edge.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "Based on the 1d case, modelling an edge as a noisy step, Canny shows that the optimal edge detection operation consists in finding local extrema of the convolution of the signal by the first order Gaussian derivative ($G'(x)$ and look for peaks). \r\n",
        "*Note*: this can prove also the optimality of the Gaussian as smoothing filter to detect noisy edges.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "To end up with a pratical 2d edge detector, we should look for local extrema of the directional derivative along the gradient (steepest increase of the function).\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "A Canny's edge detector can be straightforwardly achieved by **Gaussian smoothing followed by gradient computation and NMS along the gradient function**.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "As usual we can leverage on the separability of the Gaussian to speed-up calculations:\r\n",
        "$$\\tilde{I}_x(x,y) = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} \\bigl( I(x,y) * G(x,y) \\bigr) = I(x,y) * \\frac{\\partial G(x,y)}{\\partial x}$$\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "$$\\tilde{I}_y(x,y) = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} \\bigl( I(x,y) * G(x,y) \\bigr) = I(x,y) * \\frac{\\partial G(x,y)}{\\partial y}$$\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "due to separability $G(x,y) = G(x)G(y)$, we can rewrite:\r\n",
        "$$\\tilde{I}_x(x,y) = I(x,y) * \\bigl( G^{'}(x) G(y) \\bigr) = \\bigl( I(x,y) * G^{'}(x) \\bigr) * G(y)$$\r\n",

        "\r\n",
        "As we already seen, NMS is often followed by thresholding of gradient magnitude, in order to distinguish between \"true\" semantic edges and unwanted noisy ones.\r\n",
        "However, *edge streaking* (non-continuous contour) may occur when magnitude varies along object contours.\r\n",
        "To address this issue, Canny proposed an *hyesteresis* thresholding approach ($T_h$ and $T_l$): a pixel is taken as an edge if either the gradient magnitude is higher than $T_h$ **or** higher than $T_l$ **and** the pixel is a neighbour of an already detected edge (so it's connected to \"strong\" edges).\r\n",

        "\r\n",
        "Hysteresis thresholding is usually carried out by tracking pixels along contours, which also brings the side-effect of providing as output chains of connected edge pixels rather than edge maps.\r\n",
